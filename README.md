# Udacity_connect

This repo contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks to accompany the Udacity Connect Intensive [Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). The code is written for Python 2.7, but should be (mostly) compatible with Python 3.
